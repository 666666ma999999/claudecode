## Address Assignment (DragonScale Mechanism 2 MVP)

**Opt-in feature**. DragonScale address assignment runs only if `scripts/allocate-address.sh` is present AND `.vault-meta/` exists. Otherwise, skip this entire section and proceed with ingest normally.

**Feature detection (run at start of every ingest)**:

```bash
if [ -x ./scripts/allocate-address.sh ] && [ -d ./.vault-meta ]; then
  DRAGONSCALE_ADDRESSES=1
else
  DRAGONSCALE_ADDRESSES=0
fi
```

When `DRAGONSCALE_ADDRESSES=0`, pages are created without an `address:` frontmatter field, and `wiki-lint`'s Address Validation section is skipped entirely (missing addresses are not flagged in any severity). This preserves default plugin behavior for vaults that have not adopted DragonScale.

When `DRAGONSCALE_ADDRESSES=1`, proceed with the rest of this section.

---

Every **newly created non-meta wiki page** gets a stable address in its frontmatter:

```yaml
address: c-000042
```

Format: `c-<6-digit-counter>`. The `c-` prefix stands for "creation-order counter." Zero-padded.

Rollout baseline: **2026-04-23** (Phase 2 ship date). Pages with `created:` >= this date are post-rollout and MUST have an address (unless excluded below). Pages with `created:` earlier are legacy-exempt until a deliberate backfill pass assigns `l-NNNNNN` addresses.

### Required tool: `scripts/allocate-address.sh`

Address allocation is delegated to an atomic Bash helper. The helper uses `flock` on `.vault-meta/.address.lock` to prevent read-use-increment races and recovers the counter by scanning existing frontmatter if the counter file is missing.

```bash
ADDR=$(./scripts/allocate-address.sh)
# ADDR is now e.g. "c-000042"; counter is already incremented
```

**CRITICAL**: never use the Write or Edit tool on `.vault-meta/address-counter.txt`. That would fire the PostToolUse hook, which runs `git add wiki/ .raw/` and can accidentally commit unrelated pending wiki changes under a generic message. Counter mutation is **only** permitted through the helper script (Bash tool).

### Helper modes

- `./scripts/allocate-address.sh` — atomically reserves and returns the next address.
- `./scripts/allocate-address.sh --peek` — prints the next value without reserving (safe, read-only).
- `./scripts/allocate-address.sh --rebuild` — recomputes the counter from the highest observed `c-NNNNNN` in existing frontmatter. Never resets to 1 silently if pages already have addresses. Run this if the counter file is suspected corrupt.

### Assignment procedure (per new page)

1. Before writing a new non-meta page, call `./scripts/allocate-address.sh` and capture the output.
2. Include `address: c-XXXXXX` in the page's frontmatter.
3. Record the path-to-address mapping in `.raw/.manifest.json` under a new top-level key `address_map` (see schema below).

### `address_map` in `.raw/.manifest.json`

```json
{
  "sources": { ... },
  "address_map": {
    "wiki/concepts/Example.md": "c-000042",
    "wiki/entities/Another.md": "c-000043"
  }
}
```

On re-ingest of the same source (whether by `--force` or a changed hash), always consult `address_map` first. If the target page path has a prior address, REUSE it. Do not allocate a new one.

On a page rename, the skill must update the `address_map` key (old path -> new path) while preserving the address value.

### Exclusions (do NOT assign an address to)

- Meta files: `_index.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`, `hot.md`, `overview.md`, `dashboard.md`, `dashboard.base`, `Wiki Map.md`, `getting-started.md`.
- Fold pages under `wiki/folds/` (they use their own deterministic `fold_id`).
- Pre-rollout legacy pages (`created:` < 2026-04-23). Legacy pages get `l-NNNNNN` addresses only via a deliberate backfill operation.

### Idempotency rules

- If a page being (re)written already has an `address:` field in its current content, REUSE it. Do not allocate a new one.
- If a source is re-ingested and `address_map` has a mapping for the target path, reuse that mapping.
- If the source has been ingested before AND the target page has no address AND the page `created:` date is post-rollout, allocate an address and record it. This covers the case where an older ingest produced a page before Phase 2 rollout; the rollout cutoff still applies (pages dated pre-2026-04-23 stay legacy).

### Concurrency policy

- **Single-writer only** in Phase 2. Do not run parallel ingests from multiple Claude sessions or sub-agents that assign addresses. The `flock` in the helper prevents counter corruption but does not serialize page writes themselves.
- Sub-agents (codex, general-purpose) that are dispatched for research or review MUST NOT call the allocator. They are read-only in this respect.
- Multi-writer support is a deferred feature.

### Batch ingest

Assign addresses sequentially during single-source-ingest for each source. Do not pre-reserve a block of counter values. The helper is cheap (one lock, one integer read/write).
