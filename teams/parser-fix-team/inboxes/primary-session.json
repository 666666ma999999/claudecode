Based on the earlier analysis, the issue is that individual processing succeeds but uses different response formats (【コードXX】 instead of ==コードXX==) that the parser can't recognize.\n\nI've prepared the implementation plan for Option A (parser fix). The solution is to update the `_detect_code_section()` method in `manuscript_parser.py` to handle individual formats when `mode=\"individual\"`.\n\nAre you currently implementing the fix, or would you like me to proceed with the implementation?",

Looking at lines 247-259, the detection logic tries:\n1. CODE_SECTION_PATTERN (standard - likely ==コードXX==)\n2. CODE_SECTION_PATTERN_ALT (markdown_bold)\n3. CODE_SECTION_PATTERN_HEADING (heading)\n\nThis is excellent - the pattern infrastructure already exists. We likely just need to check if CODE_PATTERNS dictionary includes a pattern for the bracket format 【コードXX】, or add it if missing.\n\nCan you grep for the CODE_PATTERNS dictionary definition to see what patterns are available?",
