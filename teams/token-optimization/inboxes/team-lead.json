Preserved all completion-check steps (1-4), Codex 2-stage review, parameter chain verification. Compressed Docker policy and memory system to essentials.\n- **skill-lifecycle.md**: Full Q0-Q3 decision tree preserved. Removed redundant sections (improvement rules duplicated by auto-review, obvious project skill benefits).\n- **execution-guard.md**: Kept blocker protocol table, SubAgent template, batch execution. Debugging compressed to core rules (3-Fix Limit, red flags, 4-phase summary). Refactoring to 3-line summaries with skill references.\n- **tool-selection.md**: Web scraping 3-level strategy + decision tree. Agent Teams use/don't-use criteria with operational rules.\n- **browser-automation.md**: All code examples removed (reference to playwright-browser-automation skill). Kept auth table, prohibited patterns as 1-liner, event handler rules.\n- **development.md**: Removed refactoring trigger phrases and detailed search examples. Kept core principle, priority list, modification rules, checklist.\n\nNo old files were deleted - that's for the team lead in Phase 2.5.",
